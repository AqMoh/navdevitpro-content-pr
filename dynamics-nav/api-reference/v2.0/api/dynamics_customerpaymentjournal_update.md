# Update customerPaymentJournals 
Update the properties of a customerPaymentJournal object for [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)].

## HTTP request

```

## Request headers

|Header|Value|
|------|-----|
|Authorization |Bearer {token}. Required.|

Existing properties that are not included in the request body will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values.
