# Deprecated Features in the New Zealand Version of Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2018
This topic lists and describes the local functionality for New Zealand that has been removed from [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)], made available from a new page or report, or replaced by a new feature.

## GST Sales and GST Purchase Reports
You can use the GST sales report and GST purchase report to reconcile the sales and purchase amounts recorded in business activity statements (BAS).

|Moved, Removed, or Replaced?|Why?|
|----|----|
|Replaced| To make the reports easier to use we have converted them to pages. For example, this means that you can filter by date, and export the data to Excel.  |

## Simulation Entries
The **Simulation Registers** window contains posted simulation entries that you can verify before transferring the simulation entries into real accounting entries.
